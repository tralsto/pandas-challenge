# pandas-challenge

This repository will include all of my items to be graded for the pandas challenge.

In the analysis of the PyCity Schools, we are analyzing data from a school population including charter and district schools. In this analysis you will see the data being shown in terms of school type, school size, student information, budgets, and test scores. This will allow the data to be analyzed to see if there are any contributing factors which cause some schools to have higher/lower test scores compared to other schools.

From our analysis, it can be seen that the majority of students have higher reading scores and therefore passing scores in comparison to their math scores. In addition, when comparing the budget verses student scores there does not seem to be a correlation between the two as some schools with smaller budgets have higher scores than schools with more money and visa versa. However, you can see at the end of the analysis students who attend small and medium schools tend to have better scores than those students who attend large schools.
